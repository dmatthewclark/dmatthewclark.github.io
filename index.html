                    Hello!
                    My name is David Matthew Clark, but my friends call me Matt (I go by my second name).
                    Welcome to my website. 
                    Feel free to explore and discover some of my passions. 
                    I am happy to share with anyone who is interested in learning.</p>
                <p>
                    I have a Bachelor's in Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour from McMaster University. 
                    I have always been strongly motivated to learn and understand behaviour from a scientific perspective.
                    I have a keen interest in data analysis, ensuring my findings and beliefs are backed by reliable and valid data. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A more recent but strong interest of mine is game development. 
                    I picked up the Godot game engine on June 2024 and have started many projects since then.
                    You are welcome to explore my portfolio and follow my progress. 
                    Games have always been a large part of my life so I am excited to contribute my own creations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My research primarily focuses on mental disorder and cognitive decline. 
                    I am particularly fascinated by Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as well as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
                    Our understanding of these disorders improves with each day but there is still a long way to go. 
                    It is important that we continue discussing research in this field to help improve the quality of life for neurodivergent populations.

                <p>
                    I enjoy a wide variety of genres in video games. 
                    My most beloved games as a child include Crash Bandicoot and Little Big Planet. 
                    My teenage years introduced me to Terraria and Max Payne.
                    Now as an adult I have grown to love Arma 3, Phasmophobia, and Supreme Commander.
                    I draw a great deal of my inspiration from these games as I turn towards game development myself.
                    I am fascinated with first-person/third-person controllers, inventory systems, physics interactions, ragdoll physics, vehicles, and much more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My most prized creation so far is the submission my brother and I made towards the slow-burn horror game jam. 
                    We created a story-rich physics-based 3D platforming puzzle game. 
                    I encourage you to check it out in my Portfolio. 
                    It is an incredibly rewarding experience to start and finish a project.
